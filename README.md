# BattleTank
Welcome to BattleTank! This is a game project from the famous Udemy course: [Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/). Although this is a very simple game, to make the game playable and fun, it makes use of various concepts and subsystems in Unreal4 to provide a fairly complete game system, including:

* Battleground in which the player fights with enemy vehicles:
